          We fulfill our orders via Leopard Courier Service all across Pakistan.
          Our Shipping policy includes a delivery time of 24 hours in Karachi
          and 2 to 3 business working days Pakistan-wide as overnight shipment.
          The fulfillment lead time begins when the company receives the
          package.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;All orders received before 3 PM or 15:00 HRS will be dispatched
          to Leopards the same day and will be in their warehouse at night,
          ready to ship the next morning in 2 working days.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          If the total cart amount exceeds PKR 30,000, Leopard Courier charges
          an additional 1.5% Cash Handling Charges country-wide where ever they
          deliver. If the amount is below PKR 30,000, so no amount is charged.
          Moreover, if the threshold of PKR 30,000 is crossed, the payment must
          be made in advance by online payment methods such as Debit/Credit
          Card.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;During transit time, if the customer wants any changes (address,
          phone number, payment method) after order booking, the delivery time
          may slightly increase by 2 to 3 days. However, the shipment will
          arrive in the maximum lead time of 7 days. However, if the changes are
          required before the parcel dispatch, then the order will arrive in the
          regular lead time promised.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          In case of any tracking issue, the customer can go to (INSERT LEOPARD
          LINK) and check the update.
