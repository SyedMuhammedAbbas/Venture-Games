          <p>Console disc (DVD) error?</p>
          <p>
            Make sure the disc you are inserting&nbsp; in the console is scratch
            less.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clean the disc with a soft clean microfiber cloth to remove any
            dirt, prints or stains to improve functionality
          </p>
          <p>Try to Reinstall the game.</p>
          <p>
            If you've tried the steps above and your console still isn't able to
            read the disc, then try inserting different&nbsp; DVDs one by one,
            in your system and after this if the issue persists then this is a
            major indicator that your console lance (ROM) is weak and needs
            repair.

            <strong>What Causes PlayStation to Overheat?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If your PS4 is overheating, you'll usually see a pop alert message
            stating that: “The ps4 is too hot. Hence, turn off the console and
            wait until the console temperature is back to normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            There can be multiple causes of PlayStation console overheating and
            it can be detrimental in the long run. Hence, one should take good
            care to prevent such issues and enjoy the true gaming experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your PS4 may overheat if the vents and heatsink are blocked by dust
            particles, or if there isn't enough clearance between the vents and
            other objects for smooth airflow.
            <br /> <br /> Other than this the console tends to overheat if the
            thermal paste has dried or needs reapplication.
            <br /> <br /> The temperature in your room is a vital factor that
            has a major impact on the console’s performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Resolve PlayStation Overheating issue?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A few helpful remedies to overcome the overheating issue includes:
            <br /> *Cleaning your console from the dust particles with a help of
            a brush to maintain air flow
            <br /> *Reapplying to the thermal paste. (Thermal paste is a silver
            liquid you apply to a processor to transfer heat to a cooling
            solution.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Should I replace the analog caps?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, you can but remember to change both caps simultaneously as the
            color differs.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is drifting issue can be repairable?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes if your controller has drifting issue you can replace with the
            other one but accuracy is 90 to 95%.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Controller button issue?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If your controller has button malfunctioning issue like no response
            on pressing continuously then it means we need to replace the
            conductive film/Ribbon.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Controller Charging Issue?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are multiple reasons for this problem.
            <br /> Battery: First check your controller whether it is connected
            with charging wire. If it is responding with cable only then it
            means that the battery is dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack Issue/Flex Cable: If the controller is not responding with wire
            it means the charging jack needs replacement along with the
            circuit).
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Console Issues:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Power Related issue: In this case the console does not respond or
            sometimes the power lights start blinking&nbsp; and later shut off
            which is a power supply related issue. However, if it shuts down
            after few minutes then probably the power supply is weak and ICs
            temperature shoot up..
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>DVD ROM:</p>
          <p>
            If your console has some DVD insertion issue or ejecting that means
            ROM has to be fixed. If you have any sort of disc error like dirty,
            damage in multiple DVDs or unrecognized disc issue so this means the
            lens needs repair.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Ports:</p>
          <p>
            If you face console display issues, and HDMI Cable and TV port are
            working perfectly alright then this issue highlights a fault in HDMI
            IC or HDMI Port.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the USB ports of the console not working, it means module IC has
            to be fixed.

          <p>What can I sell on Venture Games?</p>
          <p>
            You can sell New and Used gaming products (includes PlayStation
            Xbox, CD’s etc.)
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>What do I need to sell on Venture Games?</p>
          <p>
            To sell on Venture Games, you will need a product, a pick-up
            address, and payment details.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Can I use my credit card in PlayStation network?</p>
          <p>No, you can’t because Sony has restricted region connectivity.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Differences PlayStation 5 model?</p>
          <p>
            The biggest aspect of the new PS5 model is it's significantly
            smaller heatsink.
          </p>
          <p>What are Regions 2 and All?</p>
          <p>
            This refers to the region of the game As game releases vary in
            different parts of the globe so separate codes as per regions are
            rolled out for this cause. This code gives you an idea of where the
            game was released/distributed. In Pakistan, most games are region 2
            from UAE in PlayStation you can play region 2 discs in any of the
            PlayStation account regions, but if you like to add on the content
            or Downloadable Content (DLC) and code mentioned in the disc you
            need to the same account of the region of the disc-like if you have
            the disc in region 2 (UAE) so then your account should also be the
            same for region 2 to use the code and add on content or DLC. In
            Region all Disc (USA) you can use code and DLC to any region
            account.
          </p>
          <p>What region account should I create?</p>
          <p>
            In Pakistan, we would recommend you to create a US account due to
            lower pricing as compared to UK and UAE. Moreover, these three are
            easily available in Pakistan.
          </p>
          <p>Can I change my account’s region or state?</p>
          <p>No, you can’t change the region but the state can be changed.</p>
          <p>Is it necessary to buy Same region code?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, its always necessary to buy same region code which you have
            created in PlayStation network.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Is it necessary to have same region’s console and PlayStation
            network account?
          </p>
          <p>
            No, console region has nothing to do with your PlayStation network
            account, you can create any region account from your console.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>PlayStation membership directly code available?</p>
          <p>
            You have two options to buy PlayStation membership. The first one is
            to buy membership from gift card which costs&nbsp; higher as compare
            to the second option. Second option is first buy PlayStation
            essential code and to update extra or premium membership from gift
            card. Directly PS extra and premium code are available.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Does region matter for PS4 and Ps5 games?</p>
          <p>
            PlayStation games can be played on any PlayStation system from any
            region. Game add-on content availability is based on the
            country/region associated with the country in which your account on
            the PlayStation Network was created. This includes downloadable
            content (DLC) and items that can be consumed (in-game currency).
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure you will be able to access your add-on content and DLC,
            make sure the following match:
          </p>
          <p>
            The country/region in which your account on the PlayStation Network
            was created.
          </p>
          <p>The game disc country/region.</p>
          <p>The add-on country/region.</p>
          <p>
            If the 3 areas above do not match, you will not be able to access
            any of the add-on content for the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid this, before purchasing a game disc, make sure that the
