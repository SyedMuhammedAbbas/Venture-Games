    product_description:
      "The PlayStation 5 is a giant technical leap over the PlayStation 4. The console comes with 16GB of GDDR6 memory and a custom RDNA 2 AMD graphics chip that can output 10.28 TFLOPS of graphics processing power with ray tracing enabled. To further explain, ray tracing simulates the way light moves and how it bounces off various surfaces in real life. PlayStation 5 games that use ray tracing will have water, glass, light refraction, and a characterâ€™s hair that looks even more realistic. One of the main features of the PS5 is the super-fast SSD with a custom I/O. This allows the PS5 to boot a game in a matter of seconds and many games will not contain any load screens at all. For example, the PlayStation 5 can load 16GB of data in just two seconds. In comparison, it would take the PlayStation 4 a total of 32 seconds to load that same amount of data. In addition to an RDNA 2 based graphics chip, the PS5 contains a custom engine for 3D audio, which gives every sound in a game dimensionality. The PlayStation 5 is backwards compatible with the overwhelming majority of PlayStation 4 titles. That means you can play your favourite PS4 games on PS5 with more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions.",
